== A Note on comments

You may spot a number of comments in this repository that look a little like this:

[source,java]
----
// tag::something[]
someCode()
// end::something[]
----


We use link:https://asciidoc-py.github.io/index.html[Asciidoc^] to author our courses.
Using these tags means that we can use a macro to include portions of code directly into the course itself.

From the point of view of the course, you can go ahead and ignore them.
